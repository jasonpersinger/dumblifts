  <h1>How to Do Progressive Overload With Fixed Dumbbells</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">The jumps are bigger than a barbell. Here's how to handle that.</p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Progressive overload is simple in theory: do more than you did last time. With a barbell, that means adding 2.5 or 5 pounds to the bar every session. Small jumps, steady progress.</p>
  <p>Dumbbells don't work that way. Most gyms have fixed dumbbells that go up in 5-pound increments. If you're pressing 20s and you jump to 25s, that's a 25% increase per hand. For a barbell bench press at 135 pounds, a 5-pound increase is less than 4%. The dumbbell jump is much bigger relative to the weight.</p>
  <p>This is the main reason people think dumbbells aren't good for strength training. They're wrong. You just need a different approach to progression.</p>

  <h2>The Strategy</h2>
  <p>Instead of adding weight every session, you earn the right to jump by building at your current weight. Here's how it works:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start with 5x5.</strong> Pick a weight where you can complete all 5 sets of 5 reps with good form, but the last set is challenging.</li>
    <li><strong>Own the weight.</strong> Keep doing 5x5 at that weight until every set feels controlled. Not easy, but controlled. You should feel like you could do 6 or 7 reps on most sets.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the jump.</strong> Grab the next pair up. You probably won't get 5x5 right away. Maybe you get 5/5/4/3/3. That's fine. That's expected.</li>
    <li><strong>Build back to 5x5.</strong> Over the next few sessions, your reps will climb. 5/5/5/4/4. Then 5/5/5/5/4. Then 5x5. Now you own this weight too.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat.</strong> This cycle is the program.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How Long Does Each Jump Take?</h2>
  <p>It depends on the exercise and the weight. Early on, when weights are lighter, you might jump every week or two. As you get stronger and the weights get heavier, jumps might take three or four weeks. That's normal.</p>
  <p>Overhead press will progress slower than rows. Pressing movements are generally harder to increase than pulling movements. Don't compare your press progress to your row progress.</p>

  <h2>What Stalling Looks Like</h2>
  <p>You've been at the same weight for three sessions and you're not getting more reps. Maybe you're stuck at 5/5/4/3/3 and it's not budging. That's a stall.</p>
  <p>Stalling is not failure. It's information. It means your body needs a different stimulus to keep adapting. That's where deloading comes in.</p>

  <h2>The Deload Protocol</h2>
  <p>When you stall at a weight for three consecutive sessions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Drop the weight by 10%.</strong> If you're stuck at 30-pound dumbbells, go back to 25s.</li>
    <li><strong>Do your 5x5 at the lighter weight.</strong> It will feel easy. Good. That's the point.</li>
    <li><strong>Work back up.</strong> You'll usually blow through the weight that stalled you before. Your body needed the recovery.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Why does this work? Strength isn't just about muscle. Your nervous system needs recovery too. Weeks of grinding at a heavy weight accumulate fatigue. The deload clears that fatigue so you can push past where you were stuck.</p>
  <p>Think of it like a running start. You back up so you can jump further.</p>

  <h2>Tracking Matters</h2>
  <p>You can't manage what you don't measure. If you don't write down your weights and reps, you're guessing. Did you get 3 or 4 reps on that last set? Was this the second or third session at this weight?</p>
  <p>DUMBLIFTS tracks every set, every rep, every weight. It shows you when you've hit a personal record and keeps a history of your progress. When it's time to deload, you can see exactly where to drop back to.</p>
